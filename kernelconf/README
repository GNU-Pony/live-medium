These are premade configurations you can use for when you compile the kernel:


KERNEL_CONFIG = kernelconf/kernel.mini.config
  A small configuration that should build much quicker than the other
  configurations and can be used for testing.


KERNEL_CONFIG = kernelconf/kernel.hpc.config
  A base configuration for high performance computing, you should
  however trim it to fit your needs.


KERNEL_CONFIG = kernelconf/kernel.config
  A standard configuration that should work on most systems.
